# 100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python Bootcamp journey! This repository contains all the projects and exercises I've completed as part of learning Python programming.

## Overview

This bootcamp covers fundamental Python concepts through hands-on projects, progressing from basic syntax to more advanced programming concepts. Each day focuses on a specific topic with a practical project to reinforce learning.

## Project Structure

Each day is organized in its own folder with the following structure:

- `DayXX-Project_name/` - Contains the project files for that specific day
- Each folder includes a `README.md` with project details and instructions
- Python source files implementing the day's project

## Completed Days

| Day | Project | Concepts Learned |
|-----|---------|------------------|
| [Day 01](./Day01-Band_name_generator/) | Band Name Generator | Variables, Input/Output, String Manipulation |
| [Day 02](./Day02-Tip_calculator/) | Tip Calculator | Data Types, Type Conversion, Mathematical Operations |
| [Day 03](./Day03-Treasure_hunt_game/) | Treasure Island Game | Conditional Statements, Logical Operators, Control Flow |
| [Day 04](./Day04-Rock_paper_scissors_game/) | Rock Paper Scissors | Random Module, Lists, Control Flow |
| [Day 05](./Day05-Password_generator/) | Password Generator | Loops, Random Selection, String Manipulation |
| [Day 07](./Day07-Hangman/) | Hangman Game | Functions, Lists, String Methods, Game Logic |
| [Day 08](./Day08-Caesar_cipher/) | Caesar Cipher | Functions with Parameters, Modular Arithmetic |
| [Day 09](./Day09-Silent_auction/) | Silent Auction | Dictionaries, Nested Data Structures |
| [Day 10](./Day10-Calculator/) | Calculator | Functions with Outputs, Recursion, Calculator Logic |
| [Day 11](./Day11-BlackJack/) | Blackjack Game | Lists, Functions, Game Logic, Card Games |
| [Day 12](./Day12-GuessTheNumber/) | Guess the Number | Scope, Global vs Local Variables, Game Logic |
| [Day 14](./Day14-HigherLowerGame/) | Higher Lower Game | Classes, Objects, Type Hints, Error Handling, OOP |

## How to Run the Projects

1. Navigate to the specific day's folder
2. Run the Python file using: `python filename.py`
3. Follow the prompts and enjoy the interactive experience!

## Learning Objectives

Through this bootcamp, I'm developing skills in:

- Python syntax and fundamentals
- Problem-solving and logical thinking
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Code organization and best practices
- Interactive program development
- Game development basics

## Progress

- âœ… Days 1-5: Basic Python fundamentals
- âœ… Days 7-12: Intermediate concepts and game development
- âœ… Day 14: Object-Oriented Programming and advanced concepts
- ðŸ”„ Currently working on: Advanced topics and web development

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** - Primary programming language
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Code organization and structure
- **Built-in Python modules** - random, string manipulation, etc.

## Getting Started

To explore any project:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the desired day's folder
3. Read the specific README.md for that project
4. Run the Python file to experience the project

## Future Plans

- Continue with Days 15-100
- Refactor older projects with improved techniques
- Add unit tests for projects
- Create a web interface for some projects
